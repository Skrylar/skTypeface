skTypeface Notes

-   The results of width/height from rasterization may differ from the glyph metrics function.

    This is an artifact of the backend (GDI is really silly) and needs some
    tending to.   
    Trust the results of the glyph measuring function, and apply clipping to
    the rasterized output when needed.

-   There is no support for FreeType2 or OS X *at the moment*.

    Support is easily bolted on and planned, I just want to get on with
    other things at the moment.
